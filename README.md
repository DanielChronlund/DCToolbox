<h2>Included Tools</h2>

<h3>Connect-DCMsGraphAsDelegated</h3>

Connect to Microsoft Graph with delegated credentials (interactive login will popup).

<h3>Connect-DCMsGraphAsApplication</h3>

Connect to Microsoft Graph with application credentials.

<h3>Invoke-DCMsGraphQuery</h3>

Run a Microsoft Graph query.

<h3>Enable-DCAzureADPIMRole</h3>

Activate an Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) role with PowerShell.

<h3>Get-DCPublicIp</h3>

Get current public IP address information. You can use the -UseTorHttpProxy to route traffic through a running Tor network HTTP proxy that was started by Start-DCTorHttpProxy.

<h3>Start-DCTorHttpProxy</h3>

Start a Tor network HTTP proxy that can be used for anonymization of HTTP traffic in PowerShell. Requires proxy support in the PowerShell CMDlet you want to anonymise. Many of the tools included in DCToolbox supports this.

<h3>Test-DCAzureAdUserExistence</h3>

Test if an account exists in Azure AD for specified email addresses.

<h3>Test-DCAzureAdCommonAdmins</h3>

Test if common and easily guessed admin usernames exist for specified Azure AD domains.

<h3>Export-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesign</h3>

This CMDlet uses Microsoft Graph to export all Conditional Access policies in the tenant to a JSON file. This JSON file can be used for backup, documentation or to deploy the same policies again with Import-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesign.

<h3>Import-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesign</h3>

This CMDlet uses Microsoft Graph to automatically create Conditional Access policies from a JSON file. The JSON file can be created from existing policies with Export-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesign or manually by following the syntax described in the Microsoft Graph documentation.

<h3>Export-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesignAsApp</h3>

This CMDlet uses Microsoft Graph to export all Conditional Access policies in the tenant to a JSON file. This JSON file can be used for backup, documentation or to deploy the same policies again with Import-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesign.

This CMDlet is the same as Export-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesign just uses Application level permissions rather than delegated. 

<h3>Import-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesignAsApp</h3>

This CMDlet uses Microsoft Graph to automatically create Conditional Access policies from a JSON file. The JSON file can be created from existing policies with Export-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesign or manually by following the syntax described in the Microsoft Graph documentation.

This CMDlet is the same as Import-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesign just uses Application level permissions rather than delegated. 

<h3>New-DCConditionalAccessPolicyDesignReport</h3>

Automatically generate an Excel report containing your current Conditional Access policy design.

<h3>New-DCConditionalAccessAssignmentReport</h3>

Automatically generate an Excel report containing your current Conditional Access assignments.
